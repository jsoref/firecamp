## API Playgrounds
There is a dedicated GUI playground for each API protocol you would be using for your stack.

### :one: **Rest Playground**
It's the lightweight, IntelliSense, and next-generation testing client to give the most delightful collaborative experience while building APIs in a team.

[Learn more](https://firecamp.io/docs/rest/introduction)

### :two: **GraphQL Playground**
Perform GraphQL operations with a seamless experience. Prepare, Share, and Export your Query Collection collaboratively with your team.

[Learn more](https://firecamp.io/docs/graphql/introduction)

### :three: **WebSocket Playground**
Debug bidirectional connection visually with WebSocket GUI client more precisely now. The only GUI client to test, debug, and visualize real-time or event-driven messages collaboratively.

[Learn more](https://firecamp.io/docs/websocket/introduction)

### :four: **Socket.io Playground**
Monitor each emitter‚Äôs and listener‚Äôs events visually over a bi-directional SocketIO connection. It enables you to collaborate with the team over a SocketIO event-driven API build.

## Roadmap 
  Here is the Firecamp development roadmap. Very soon It'll be listed on GitHub projects for better project management.
- **AI: Cutting-edge AI-powered capabilities**
- **Firecamp CLI:** developer-friendly CLI tool
- **Test Runner:** An advanced API test runner
- **Proxy:** A versatile built-in proxy
- **SSL:** Robust SSL support
- **History:** Seamless history tracking
- **DX:** Improved developer experience
- **Documentation:** Enhanced API documentation
- **CI/CD:** Seamless integration with CI/CD workflows
- Undisclosed Platform Phase-2

## Philosophy
The decentralization of tools, processes, and people creates friction in API development workflow and frustration across the team. Developers are constantly switching between tools, searching for information, and wasting time due to inefficient tools.
We believe that the existing solution lacks both world-class experience and the simplicity needed to build APIs faster. This leads to a decrease in developer productivity, slow release times, and poor team collaboration.
We are bringing the VS code philosophy to Firecamp to solve this critical problem. Our mission is to build the most extensible, minimal and best developer experience API platform where developers feel most productive while building APIs.

## What's cool about this?

Firecamp is a Multi-protocol API platform, which offers end-to-end testing and development of Rest, GraphQL, WebSocket, and many other APIs.
We support major API specifications and protocols, which allows for seamless API testing, API documentation, and smoother collaboration between backend, frontend, and mobile teams.
